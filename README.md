# Data-Science--Mathematics
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

## NATIVE AMERICAN DIABETES DATASET 

### I.	INTRODUCTION
The sedentary lifestyle in modern society has led to a high number of Americans diagnosed with diabetes. According to a CDC report in 2017, more than 100 million Americans are now living with diabetes or prediabetes, which can eventually result in serious health complications including premature death, vision loss, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure. For this reason, our group decides to explore a dataset to identify the main factors causing diabetes among a group of patients belonging to the Pima Indian heritage (subgroup of Native Americans).
